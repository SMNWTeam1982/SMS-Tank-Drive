# SMS Tank Drive
This is a Command Based implementation of Differential Drive for Shawnee Mission South's engineering department and (now defunct) FRC Team 1984.

The code in this repository is designed with FRC competition standards in mind, although the robot is only for demonstration purposes. Despite this, it is still a useful demo codebase and has extensive internal documentation and comments for future maintenance and readability purposes.
